                                    <h1 className="text-2xl text-left font-sans">Hello my name is Mateo Yajure. I am a second year student enrolled in the Computer Engineering program at the University of Waterloo.<br/><br/> I am a slightly obsessive person about my goals and learning, often driven by a desire to achieve. I have been programming since I was eight years old, and I have helped many elementary and high-school students take their first steps in their coding journeys. < br/><br/> Some of the programming interests I have had the longest are game development and robotics. I was extremely fortunate to be exposed to technology when I was really young and I was fortunate enough to share my passion with younger students who are just like I was. I have been responsible for running 6 workshops over the past few years which has been a rewarding venue to give back to my community and share the joy of code.</h1>
